        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Onigiri are traditional Japanese rice balls typically shaped into triangles or rounds and filled with savory ingredients like 
            umeboshi, tuna, or salmon, often wrapped in nori seaweed for a portable, satisfying snack. They are a staple in bento boxes and are enjoyed for their convenience and flavor.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure 2¼ cups of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice and rinse it thoroughly under cool water until the water runs clear, using a fine-mesh strainer.</li>
            <li>Cook the rinsed rice with 2½ cups of water in a rice cooker or saucepan, following standard instructions for Japanese rice (typically a 1:1.1 to 1:1.2 rice-to-water ratio).
                Allow the rice to rest for 10 minutes after cooking.</li>
            <li>While the rice cooks, prepare fillings: mix tuna with Kewpie mayonnaise and 1 tsp soy sauce; combine bonito flakes with 2 tsp soy sauce to make a damp mixture.</li>
            <li>Set up an assembly line: place fillings on a rimmed baking sheet, cover the work surface with plastic wrap, and have a bowl of warm water (with ½ tsp salt dissolved) ready for wetting hands.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands in the salted water, then scoop about 1/3 cup (65 g) of warm rice onto the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Gently shape the rice into a triangle using your palms, then make a small indentation in the center.</li>
            <li>Add 1–2 tsp of filling (tuna mayo or bonito soy sauce) into the indentation, then cover with more rice and press firmly to seal.</li>
            <li>Shape the rice ball into a triangle by pressing between your hands, ensuring it holds its form.</li>
            <li>Wrap the onigiri with a 1- by 4-inch strip of nori, pressing lightly to adhere.</li>
            <li>Coat the outside with furikake seasoning by dipping each side into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Place finished onigiri on a tray covered with a damp cloth to prevent drying.</li>
        </ol>
