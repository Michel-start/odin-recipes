        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Arepas are traditional flatbreads from Colombia and Venezuela, made from pre-cooked cornmeal, naturally gluten-free and often vegan.
            They are versatile, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and can be served plain or stuffed with a variety of fillings.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-cooked cornmeal (masarepa or P.A.N. flour)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Warm Water</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil or Butter</li>
            <li>Optional fillings: Cheese, avocado, black beans, scrambled eggs, or your favorite savory ingredients</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the warm water and salt, stirring until dissolved.
            Gradually add the pre-cooked cornmeal while mixing with your hands or a spoon until a soft, moist, and malleable dough forms.
            The dough should be tacky but not sticky; if too dry, add water 1 tablespoon at a time; if too sticky, add a small amount of cornmeal.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and let the dough rest for at least 5–10 minutes to hydrate.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 equal portions (about 1/4 to 1/3 cup each). Roll each portion into a ball using moist hands.
                Flatten each ball into a disk about 3–4 inches (7.5–10 cm) in diameter and 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick, ensuring smooth edges.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the surface with vegetable oil or butter. Add the arepas in batches and cook for 5–7 minutes per side, 
                or until golden brown with a dry, slightly charred crust. For a crispier texture, cook longer; for a softer interior, reduce time slightly.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked arepas to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Once cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to slice each arepa horizontally halfway through, creating a pocket.
                Fill with cheese, avocado, beans, or other desired fillings.</li>
        </ol>
