        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a classic Italian dish consisting of a thin, baked dough base topped with sauce, cheese, and various ingredients, often baked at high temperatures for a crisp crust.
            This recipe guide provides a foundational approach to making homemade pizza from scratch, suitable for beginners and adaptable to different tastes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Passata</li>
            <li>Fresh Basil</li>
            <li>Garlic Clove</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil, and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil, and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Top and bake: Heat the oven to 240°C/220°C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over the bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil, and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8–10 minutes until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil and basil leaves if using. Repeat for the remaining pizza.</li>
